As a designer I like facing challenges and had fun working on this one.
I worked after work untill I could. Not as much as I wanted.

The setup was pretty easy to do.
The major issues came out about shuffling the deck and moving the cards.

I think the shuffle is working but not showing due to some problem in the subset creation 
(as you can see, only one card is showing at the time I'm writing this).

About moving the cards, It actually works, but on the debug card only, as the code is not recognizing all the others 
by the tag. Working on it.




If I had more time I would have cared more about the graphic part and the UX, considering some microanimations 
(shuffling or displaying the deck on the table would be cool too) or effects around the cards to show if the move 
is legal/illegal. 

About the JSON, I would use it to save the game, change the language and show your best games according to how many
moves on you've done. If the game provides SFX and soundtrack, the JSON could also be used to store the preferences
about them (start a game with no sound but only SFX, as you left it).
